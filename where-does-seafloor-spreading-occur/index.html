<p>D Molten material beneath Earths crust rises to the surface. As upwelling of magma continues the plates continue to diverge a process known as seafloor spreading. Seafloor spreading is the movement of old rock that is being pushed by the new young oceanic crust. As tectonic plates slowly move away from each other heat from the mantles convection currents makes the crust more plastic and less dense.
