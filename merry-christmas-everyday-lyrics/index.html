<p>Oh I wish it could be Christmas everyday Let the bells ring out for Christmas When were skating in the park If the storm cloud paints it dark Then your rosy cheeks gonna light my merry way Now the frosticles appear And theyve frozen up my beard So well lie by the fire till the sleep simply melts them all away Well I wish it could be. Brings This Night We Pray Our Lives Will Show This Dream He Had Each Child Still Knows. All I wish that everyday was Christmas What a nice way to spend the year Were gonna have a party tonight Im gonna find that girl underneath the mistletoe Well kiss by candlelight Snow is falling All around me Children playing Having fun Its the season Love and understanding Merry Christmas everyone Merry Christmas everyone Ooh merry. What A Lovely Christmas Christmas In The Summer Time. We Wish You a Merry Christmas Lyrics.</p>
