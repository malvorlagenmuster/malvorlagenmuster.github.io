<p>Written by Bob Heatlie and produced by Dave Edmunds it was the fourth number one and last number one single for Shakin Stevens on the UK Singles Chart. Since it was first performed by Shakin Stevens in 1985 went through many various compilations and performances.

Is a masterful arrangement of several classic and well known Christmas carols may be performed by band alone. This the most cynical of Shakeys output. We propose here notation in the form of scores and notes for each instrument separately and our own unique arrangement for classical guitar solo fingerstyle.</p>
